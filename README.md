~~~ KNOWN ISSUES ~~~
  - TWO KNOWN BUGS IN GAME LOGIC
    (1) Creating and analyzing correct moves from a 'fork' starting position - where two or more different jumps
        are possible.
    (2) The Illegal move from hell - as it is now, when playing as black, moving 'b' to (0:0) or Pos:32 does
         not result in 'b' being Kinged.

    -I'm currently restructuring entire move logic to address the forking issue.
    hopefully Illegal move from hell will fix itself when new logic and move structure is in place.
